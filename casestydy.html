            Sector)

          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Mark, despite strong experience, struggled for six months to clear
            Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) for senior roles. His valuable
            background was being consistently overlooked because of a generic
            resume template and outdated formatting. Applications were
            repeatedly blocked due to these technical hurdles, preventing his
            career from moving forward effectively.
          </p>

          <h3>Resume Revamp</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Technical Overhaul: Rebuilt the resume structure to achieve 95%+
              ATS compliance score.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keyword Integration: Researched and embedded high-value,
              industry-specific keywords (e.g., Agile Transformation, P&L
              Oversight) relevant to Director roles.
            </li>
            <li>
              Results-Driven Copy: Transformed descriptive bullet points into
              quantifiable achievement statements (e.g., "Led team" became
              "Drove a 20% revenue increase through new product feature").
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>200% Lead Conversion Boost</h2>
          <div class="client-meta">
            Role: Marketing Consultant | Previous Company Affiliation: Tesla
          </div>

          </div>

          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            A high-performing Real Estate Broker had an attractive property
            site, but the main lead-capture page was underperforming. Only 5% of
            high-intent traffic converted into qualified leads through the
            "Contact Agent" form. The broker required a focused, high-speed
            landing page engineered solely for immediate conversion and serious
            buyer/seller capture.
          </p>

          <h3>Landing Page Development</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Value Proposition Clarity: The headline was immediately changed
              to: "Unlock Your City's Hidden & Off-Market Property List."
            </li>
            <li>
              Conversion Funnel: The main Call-to-Action became a high-value
              offer: "Download Your Free 2025 Market Report." This simple,
              specific request was placed above the fold.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trust Signals: Integrated recent high-value sales metrics and
              relevant industry association logos near the lead form to build
              instant credibility and trust.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Key Result</h3>
          <p class="key-result">
            The new, specialized landing page instantly drove the lead
            conversion rate from a poor 5% to a high 16%. This swift increase
            tripled the volume of inbound sales leads, effectively lowering the
            client's cost per acquisition and maximizing their return on
            investment.

          <h2>180% Recruiter View Spike</h2>
          <div class="client-meta">

          </div>

          <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Daniel, a skilled Website Developer, was passively seeking his next
            career opportunity, yet his online presence was limited to a static
            CV. His profile rarely appeared in targeted recruiter searches,
            causing him to miss out on valuable unsolicited roles. We recognized
            the need to revamp his CV and strategically design his portfolio
            website.
          </p>

          <h3>LinkedIn Optimization</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Headline Transformation: Changed the headline from a job title
              ("Web Developer") to a value statement: "Full-Stack Dev |
              Engineering Scalable Frontends & Microservice APIs."
            </li>
            <li>
              Recruiter Visibility Scoring: Enhanced the "About" section with a
              compelling narrative that mirrored recruiter search queries,
              highlighting targeted skills (e.g., React/Node, Cloud Deployment,
              Agile Methodologies).
            </li>

            <li>
              Featured Section: Curated and linked to a portfolio showcasing
              high-impact project code, live demos, and technical articles to
              establish authority.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The Key Result</h3>
          <p class="key-result">
            Within two months, Daniel's "profile views from recruiters" surged
            by 180%. This led directly to him receiving an unsolicited offer for
            a highly compatible Senior Developer role, which he accepted without
            ever having to submit a formal application.
